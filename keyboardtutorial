this isnt a script, it's a tutorial on how to make your own keyboard script!!!
recently ive seen a LOT of obfuscated keyboard scripts, so i decided to make it open source.
okay so first, we need to learn about the service that makes this possible. it's called VirtualUser.
VirtualUser is a service that hasn't been maintained for several years, but still works. you can find all the things about in in the roblox reference:
  [[ https://robloxapi.github.io/ref/class/VirtualUser.html ]]

so to make a keyboard, you need to make the gui first and the buttons you're gonna make. its outdated so it doesn't use Enum.KeyCode. you have to use it like "esc"

if you want to press a key, you do game:GetService("VirtualUser"):TypeKey(key: string)
if you want to hold down or release it, you do game:GetService("VirtualUser"):SetKeyDown(key: string) and game:GetService("VirtualUser"):SetKeyUp(key: string).
if you want to press a mouse button, you do game:GetService("VirtualUser"):ClickButton1(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity) and game:GetService("VirtualUser"):ClickButton2(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity)
if you want to hold down a mouse button, you do game:GetService("VirtualUser"):Button1Down(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity), game:GetService("VirtualUser"):Button1Up(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity), game:GetService("VirtualUser"):Button2Down(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity) and game:GetService("VirtualUser"):Button2Up(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity)

and some extra things are game:GetService("VirtualUser"):CaptureController(), game:GetService("VirtualUser"):MoveMouse(position: Vector2, camera: CFrame = Identity), game:GetService("VirtualUser"):StartRecording() and game:GetService("VirtualUser"):StopRecording()

you can find some keycodes here:
